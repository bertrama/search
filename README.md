# Search

This repository contains the front-end code that generates the UI and connects to the middle and backend.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone Search

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mlibrary/search.git
```

### 2. Install

```sh
$ npm install
```

### 3. Run Locally

```sh
$ npm start
```

## CSS

If you're editing SASS, run the following command to watch and build those files.

```sh
$ npm run watch:css
```

If you just want to build and not watch, then:

```sh
$ npm run build:css
```

## Local Development

Local development will only work if you have access to the UMich network. This is a requirment for communicating with the backend service (Spectrum).

## Contact

Email Jon Earley at earleyj@umich.edu if you have any questions.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). This will explain why you are seeing a lack of configuration (babel, webpack...) since Create React App is for "creating React apps with no build configuration".
