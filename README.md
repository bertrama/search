A work in progress single page app for new search. This repository contains the front-end code that generates the UI and connects to the middle and backend.

## Getting Started

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mlibrary/search.git
```

###2. Install

```

You'll need `npm` for this.

###3. Run Locally
```sh
$ npm start
```

## CSS
Enter the stylesheets directory and run Gulp. See [Falafel repo](https://github.com/mlibrary/falafel) for more setup instructions.
```sh
$ gulp
```

## Building for Production

```sh
$ npm run build
```

These files will be created in the `build` directory.

## Local Development

Local development will only work if you have access to the UMich network. This is a requirment for communicating with the backend service (Spectrum). If you have the credentials, the UMich VPN is helpful when off campus. [Instructions for getting started with the UMich VPN](http://its.umich.edu/enterprise/wifi-networks/vpn/getting-started).
